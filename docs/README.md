## üëã Hi there
This organization creates a collection of modules for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), initiated by [ZotyDev](https://github.com/ZotyDev), currently being developed and maintaned by me only.


## üé≤ Our Goal
Is to provide the Foundry community _(including us)_ with the best quality possible modules! We aim at making your experience **gamefied**, thus removing a little bit of control from your hands to allow a more streamlined experience!

Since Foundry always requires a little bit more from the GMs to prepare the adventures, we strongly believe in a **setup-once** and **reuse-forever** approach.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What We Do
- Create modules for **free**
- Update modules ofr **free**
- Provide you with support when we have enough time, for **free**
- Accept [donations](https://ko-fi.com/zotydev) üí∏ _if you feel like we deserve it_ üòÅ
- _Insert emojis everywhere, because why not?_

> But we don't want your money without offering something for that, if you donate you get **access to exclusive polls that decide the next major update of a module, and what modules will be released first!**

## ‚ùå What We Don't Do
- Require any type of **payment** for the above mentioned!
- Develop what already exists
- _Kill dragons at level 1, we just can't_

> Note that in the future we could sell package modules for a **price**, but we will **sell** only **handmade, non-AI** content, we will **never** try to sell you modules that provide functionalities or other things like that, **only** content.
>

## ü•á Credits
Many have helped to create **RPG Made Simple**, directly or indirectly, the mainly ones being:

- [Fantasy Computerworks](https://fantasycomputer.works/) is a huge inspiration and a base for our modules, without [Sequencer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer) and [ItemPiles](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles), none of our modules would be ever created! (and I started using docsify because of them)


## üìÉ License
All our modules **are** and will **always** be licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/RPG-Made-Simple/.github/blob/main/LICENSE) license, so anyone can use them, contribute or even continue our work if we cease to work on them.

_We make it simple for you!_
